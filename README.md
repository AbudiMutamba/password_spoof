2. When the user logs in, the user name and password are saved to a ﬁle called spoof file

3. The hacker then should later be able to retrieve the username and the password from the spoof file and then impersonate the user.

Make a report of at most 3 pages including screenshots of your results. A hard copy of the report should be submitted through the class representative. Submit the report and code in a zip ﬁle via MUELE. The zip ﬁle should be named after the group name.
